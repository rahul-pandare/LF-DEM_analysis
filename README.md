This repository contains scripts and tools for analyzing data generated by LF_DEM (Lubrication Flow - Discrete Element Method) simulations. It provides utilities to read, process, and visualize particle and interaction data to help researchers investigate the behavior of particulate systems.
Feel free to reach out for any questions: pandare.rahul@gmail.com.

**Data availability**: This repository does not include simulation data due to its large size. Data can be provided upon request, and we can work out a suitable way to share it. Altough a sample of 2D data is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/rxx6qem2hju61g74l2rph/ADKxo04rNM9_ogiDnHiFoO4?rlkey=dl3mzuebgek4ke92nmeexewh6&st=6jq6sdz9&dl=0).

Users can also generate their own data by running the LF-DEM code. Detailed installation instructions are available here: [LF-DEM installation](https://github.com/rahul-pandare/LFDEM-install).

├── `tests/`       Test scripts for validating functions


## Features
- Parse and load rigid cluster data, particle sizes, interaction lists, and particle parameters.
- Perform statistical and structural analysis on simulation outputs.
- Unit tests to ensure correctness of data processing functions.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LF_DEM_analysis.git
cd LF_DEM_analysis
```

Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To use the functions as a system-wide Python package, run the following from the root (after the previous step):
```bash
pip install -e .
```

This allows you to import functions for reading simulation data and calculating rigid clusters in any Python script or notebook.

Perform unit tests for test functions:

```bash
cd test/
bash test_functions.sh
```

If the tests pass, the functions are ready to use. Badge indicating test status:<br> ![Tests](https://github.com/rahul-pandare/LF-DEM_analysis/actions/workflows/run_tests.yml/badge.svg)
