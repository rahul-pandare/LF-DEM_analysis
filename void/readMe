Scripts for analysis of LF_DEM simulation data

Run the following scripts:
- rigidClusters.py (plays the pebble game)
- znet2.py         (calculates Z and Znet for each sample snapshot)
- frictParts2.py   (Gets the concact IDs for all particles in a snapshot)

Note:
- All of these scripts are independent of each other. Run the above scripts in no particular order.
- znet and fricparts take ar and phi as input. Scripts in folder ' less_used' have scripts that just take phi.
